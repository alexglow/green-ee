Responsibility \u00b6 It's important to note that we each have different amounts of the money, time, energy, knowledge, and tools it takes to make \"better\" choices.

We do know that electronics manufacturing has an outsized effect on global health. And as people interested in making electronics, we already have an incredible framework \u2013 open source \u2013 for dropping down ladders for others as we climb! Maybe I've built a new way to solar-power stuff, but it's hella expensive? \u2022 Someone could share manufacturing techniques to drop the price! \u2022 Someone could share tips to make it even more efficient, so less is needed! \u2022 Someone could get their corporation to match a donation for development/distribution! \u2022 Someone could stress-test it in their community! \u2022 Someone could write documentation! We have an incredible pool of genius that we can apply to help solve these problems. Everyone can contribute! The Earth belongs to US! <3","title":"Power / Responsibility"},{"location":"responsibility/#other-methods","text":"Outside the scope of this site, everyone can help rein in those Big Guns doing the damage, such as... \u2022 Vote for people who care, and pressure the representatives we have, to enact environmental/labor protections \u2022 Choose to purchase products and services that have good practices, and get your company to do the same \u2022 Divest from groups that support harmful practices \u2013 including banks, index funds, etc. that invest YOUR money in fossil fuels and such! \u2022 Donate to mutual aid funds, to help offset the effects of climate change and unfair practices \u2013 which disproportionately harm those who are already vulnerable \u2022 Support journalism and research into the causes of the problems + possible solutions \u2022 Support everyone's ability to vote. \u2022 Help update business culture, like including carbon offsets (such as Terrapass ) with work travel expenses Check out the UL whitepaper for more info on what drives more sustainable practices.

Also according to this paper, here are some ways that you can check on the sustainability of electronics/components you buy, or gain credibility for your own products: - Eco-Label Product Certification, at various levels covering the life cycle of the product and its materials - Environmental Product Declarations: \"An EPD is a single, comprehensive disclosure of a product\u2019s environmental impact throughout its entire lifecycle that has often been validated by an independent third-party.\" - Environmental Claims Validation - and more!
