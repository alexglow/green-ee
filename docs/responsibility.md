# Power / Responsibility

As individuals, the climate situation isn't necessarily "our" fault – but fixing it is our responsibility. (Or, rather – it's our POWER!)

Most of us don't have a huuuuge impact on how we got here, as various studies have found...
- [World's richest 1% responsible for 50% of emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/worlds-richest-1-cause-double-co2-emissions-of-poorest-50-says-oxfam)
- [Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)

[The "carbon footprint" was popularized by BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint#Origin_of_the_concept) – British Petroleum – as a way of shifting responsibility for this stuff onto the individual.

Moreover, we all have different amounts of the money, time, energy, knowledge, and tools it takes to make "better" choices. As with food, transit, and so many other parts of life, having those things broadens the choices you can safely make. Those who can take on more of this stuff, shouldn't shame those who can't – rather, they can help by making those resources more accessible to everyone!

We do know that [electronics manufacturing has an outsized effect on global health.](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Manufacturing)

We already have an incredible framework – open source – for dropping down more ladders behind us as we go!  
Maybe I've built a new way to solar-power stuff, but it's hella expensive?  
Someone could share manufacturing techniques to drop the price!  
Someone could get their corporation to match a donation for development/distribution!  
Someone could test stress-test it in their community!  
Someone could write documentation so it's more accessible in other ways!  

We have an incredible pool of genius that we can apply to help solve these problems.  
Everyone can contribute! The Earth belongs to US! <3
