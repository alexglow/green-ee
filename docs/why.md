# Q: Why am I building a new thing?
* A: To solve a need...
    * Is there an [existing project](https://green-ee.com#hardware-platforms) that does what I want / care about, rather than manufacturing something new? 
    * Is there a low-tech solution? (Like [rumble strips!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_strip))
    * Or something I can repurpose?
