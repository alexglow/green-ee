#### Why am I building a new thing?
* To solve a need:
    * Is there an [existing project](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/wiki#hardware-platforms) that does what I want / care about, rather than manufacturing something new? 
    * Is there a low-tech solution? (Like [rumble strips!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_strip))
    * Or something I can repurpose? (["The greenest phone is the one already in your pocket."](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Manufacturing))
* Learning / looking for inspiration: What can I build that will help fix things? ([Some suggestions!](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/wiki#invest-in-the-future-project-inspiration))
