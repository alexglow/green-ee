[Submit links here!](https://bit.ly/glinked)

#### Questions to address:
* [What impact can we individuals actually have?](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/wiki/Responsibility)  
* [Why am I building a new thing?](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/wiki/Why-build%3F)  
* What sustainable materials, processes, power sources, and so forth can I use in my project?  
* If I have a hardware business, how can I run that sustainably – from the website to the packaging and shipping?  
* How can we employ Reduce, Reuse, **Repair**, Recycle ([and even Rot!](http://www.tri-citiesdisposal.com/the-five-rs)) to reduce waste and environmental damage?  
* How can I use my skills and passion to help solve big problems (even in little chunks)?

Can you design or program your product to optimize energy usage around specific times of day / local sustainable energy sources? Can you charge during off-hours, and run off battery during peak usage hours?
