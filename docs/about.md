# About
**Last updated:** May 30, 2022

This site is written in [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). We chose it (Alex, with input from David Groom) because it is:  
- Lightweight (1.5MB at time of writing)  
- Easy to write, build, and update

The lightweight nature of the site is in keeping with greener webdev practices, which I've been learning about through the group [ClimateAction.Tech](https://climateaction.tech).  

**Further plans:**  
It would be EVEN GREENER to do a dark-mode version. :)  
I'd also like to try hosting it on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)!


## Background

**green-ee** is a directory of resources for building helpful electronics in a sustainable, ethical, and thoughtful way. [Alex Glow](http://alexglow.com) originally created it for her talk at [Open Hardware Summit 2022](https://2022.oshwa.org/) â€“ ["A Better Hardware Life Cycle: Build Stuff Without Feeling Like a Jerk"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c52uKKYoh2E).  
Now, it's updated occasionally with submissions from the [form](https://bit.ly/glinked). Attributions (if provided) will be included in the [commits](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/commits/main) as the site is updated on GitHub.

As someone who loves building electronics, and also gives a crap about the state of the world (ecologically / socially / etc.), I was very surprised that a directory of resources like this didn't yet seem to exist. If you know of another, please let me know! I would love to promote similar work!

I am not an expert on pretty much ANY of these things... just someone who had the free time to start digging in, and compiling and sharing this stuff.  
This list is not exhaustive! I'm sure some things are missing. Please help me fill it out :)

Things you can do:  
- [Submit your own links!](https://bit.ly/glinked) Does not require sign-in.  
- [See under the hood](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee) on GitHub. There is no direct connection between GitHub and this site; it's just the first place I kept this info (in the [wiki](https://github.com/alexglow/green-ee/wiki)), because I don't have amazing webdev skills.
